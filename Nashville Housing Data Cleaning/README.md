Based on my analysis of the Nashville Housing dataset, I've created a comprehensive SQL script to clean the data. Here's what my cleaning process addresses:

# Issues Found in the Data:

1. Date Format Issues: SaleDate includes time information that's not relevant
2. Missing Property Addresses: 29 NULL PropertyAddress values
3. Format Inconsistencies: 
   - SoldAsVacant has 4 different values (Yes, No, Y, N)
   - PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress need to be split into components
4. Duplicate Records: 7,918 duplicate ParcelIDs across different UniqueIDs
5. Potential Data Quality Issues:
   - Some properties with unusually low prices (under $100)
   - YearBuilt values range from 1799 to 2017 (some might be errors)

# Cleaning Steps in the SQL Script:

1. Date Standardization: Convert SaleDate to the proper DATE format
2. Fill Missing Addresses: Populate NULL PropertyAddress values using matching ParcelIDs
3. Address Parsing:
   - Split PropertyAddress into Address and City
   - Split OwnerAddress into Address, City, and State
4. Value Standardization: Convert Y/N to Yes/No in SoldAsVacant field
5. Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records
6. Format Standardization: Normalize ParcelID formatting
7. Data Validation:
   - Flag potential outlier prices for verification
   - Correct improbable YearBuilt values
8. Structural Improvement:
   - Remove original columns and replace with parsed versions
   - Create a clean view for analysis

This cleaning script ensures data is formatted, consistent, and ready for analysis. The script is portable and can be run in most SQL database systems with minimal modifications.
